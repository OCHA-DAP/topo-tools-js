# code-create

See `docs/reference/README.md` for the MUST/SHOULD/MAY convention, and
`docs/reference/shared.md` for rules `code-create` shares with other
tools, including the "Hierarchical code format and retention" section it
shares with `code-update`.

## Inputs

- `code-create` MUST accept exactly one input, loaded via the shared
  loader. It performs no topology gate and never touches geometry, only
  attribute columns.
- Each run MUST start from the loaded attributes (a fresh `cc_attr` copy
  of `layer_attr`), so rerunning with other settings never codes
  already-coded values.

## Level resolution

- `code-create` MUST resolve each level's own code column either via an
  explicit name/code field template pair (each containing a `{n}`
  placeholder, given together or not at all, raising if only one is given),
  or, when both are omitted, via structural auto-detection
  (`schema-map`'s `detectLevelColumnsOrSingle`, cardinality/containment
  only, no naming convention assumed).
- With explicit templates, a level `1..N` MUST resolve when it has a code
  column or a name column. A level `>= 1` whose code column is missing or
  entirely blank is seeded from its names (see Assignment). Level 0
  resolves only when its own code column exists.
- Structural auto-detection MUST raise when it finds zero levels, when
  detection sets any column aside as a supplemental coarser grouping
  (naming the columns), when any level has no existing code column, and
  when a level's cluster member collapses under its parent level
  (`verifyFunctionalCluster` with the parent's code column).
- Structurally resolved levels MUST be renumbered to a clean, relative
  `1..N` sequence, coarsest first; a genuinely constant coarsest column is
  dropped before reaching this step and never becomes a level.

## Assignment

- Min width MUST be a width list only when it has exactly one entry per
  numbered level, else raise.
- Every resolved code column MUST be cast to text, with blank values
  turned into nulls. A non-seeded level `>= 1` with any null source code
  MUST raise, naming the level and the row count.
- With source codes `copy`, each non-seeded level's source code column
  MUST be copied to its next free numbered sibling (`adm1_pcode1`), placed
  right after it, before any code is assigned.
- A seeded level MUST have its code column filled from its name column,
  raising when there is no name column. At the finest level, a name that
  repeats under one parent MUST raise.
- A level 0 code column MUST be set to the root code on every row.
- With source codes `replace` or `copy`, for each level `1..N`,
  ascending, `code-create` MUST rank that level's distinct source values
  under their parent level's assigned code (or the root code, for level
  1), sorted by source value, and overwrite the column with a fresh,
  sequential, zero-padded code (`assignNewCodes`, see
  `docs/reference/shared.md`).
- With source codes `embed`, each non-seeded level's code MUST be its
  parent's code, then the delimiter, then its own source value. When
  every source code at a level starts with its parent's source code (or
  the root code, at level 1) and is longer than it, that prefix MUST be
  removed first; when only some do, `embed` MUST raise. Without a
  delimiter, a level whose source codes differ in length MUST raise.
  Seeded levels are ranked as under `replace`.

## Outputs

- `code-create` MUST export the finest-level table, every resolved
  level's code column overwritten in place, as the main output.
- `code-create` MUST always write an overflow issues table (`cc_issues`),
  empty when no parent exceeded capacity. A level is checked only at a
  fixed width and when it was ranked (not embedded). Schema: `kind`
  (`'digit-overflow'`), `level`, `parent_code`, `assigned_code` (the
  parent's longest, then highest, child code), `child_count`,
  `min_width` (that level's width), `reason`.

## Configuration

- `code-create` MUST process exactly one input file per run.
- Root code, delimiter, and min width MUST all be given explicitly,
  validated via `resolveCodeFormat` with an empty delimiter allowed. Min
  width is a width, a coarsest-first width list, or `auto`. The root
  code is opaque, never shape-checked.
- Source codes MUST be `replace` (default), `embed`, or `copy`.
